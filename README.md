# Microbial Ecological Factors (MEFs): A Continuous Factor Model for Gut Microbiome Stratification and Disease Mapping

## 🧬 Project Abstract

Understanding the gut microbiome's role in health and disease requires models that go beyond binary case–control comparisons and discrete clustering. In this project, we introduce **Microbial Ecological Factors (MEFs)** — a set of continuous, overlapping latent factors derived from large-scale metagenomic profiles using **non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)**.

Trained on a curated dataset of over **20,000 human gut metagenomic samples**, including both healthy and diseased individuals, the MEF framework captures **ecologically meaningful gradients** of gut microbial variation. These latent factors allow a **quantitative, compositional characterization of individual microbiome states**, enabling improved generalization across populations and personalized interpretation.

### 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Scalable NMF decomposition optimized for microbiome data (KL-divergence loss)
- ✅ Factor extraction and interpretation at species level
- ✅ Cross-cohort factor generalization & sample projection
- ✅ Continuous, superimposed representation of gut microbial states
- ✅ Downstream phenotype associations & enterotype-like visualizations
- ✅ Publication-quality figures (ternary plots, heatmaps, factor loadings)
