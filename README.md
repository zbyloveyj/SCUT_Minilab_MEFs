# Microbial Ecological Factors (MEFs): A Continuous Factor Model for Gut Microbiome Stratification and Disease Mapping
## Project Abstract
Understanding the gut microbiome's role in health and disease requires models that go beyond binary case–control comparisons and discrete clustering. In this project, we introduce Microbial Ecological Factors (MEFs) — a set of continuous, overlapping latent factors derived from large-scale metagenomic profiles using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Trained on a curated dataset of 20,000+ samples across healthy and disease states, the MEF framework captures core gradients of gut microbial variation with biological interpretability.
